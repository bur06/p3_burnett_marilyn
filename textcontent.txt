Personal:
•	Married for almost 14 years
•	2 boys (ages 9 & 13)
•	Work full-time for the largest healthcare company in the world
•	Enjoy the water more than being on land

Swimming background:
•	Swam competitively for 12 years.  
o	Accolades include All-America in HS and College (DII)
o	Top 10 finisher at DII Nationals
•	Lifeguard for 5 years
•	Age-group swim coach for 2 years
•	Taught group and private swim lessons for almost 30 years

Lesson Philosophy:
•	#1 priority is water safety, then working on the skills to swim
•	I don’t follow a specific lesson program as I believe in meeting the child where they are
o	The methods to teach swimming skills to your child are the same methods I used on my own boys to get them swimming.  
•	I gain their trust before I push them out of their comfort zone
•	I believe in pushing them but not scaring them
•	I teach each child based on their individual abilities
•	I recommend 2 lessons a week and ask the parents to reinforce their skills they’ve learned in either the pool or some cases, their bathtub.  
o	But the number is really dependent on the family needs/wants
•	Lessons are shorter (20 – 30 minutes) because the child is moving for most of the lesson
•	Lessons can look like play more than instructions; some children respond better in that setting
